this year's SciCoW is focused on introducing Python, Jupyter and Biopython. Students first followed the CodeHS "Intro to Computer Science in Python" [course](https://codehs.com/course/5657/overview). In particular, they finished Chapter 2 "Turtle Graphics" before we started the in-person workshops. After that, students continue to follow the online course, while our in-person workshops were aimed introducing them to the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Lab interface and the use of [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) for biological applications.
